# 🧠 Data Structures with Python

This repository contains simple and beginner-friendly implementations of essential data structures using Python. Each data structure is implemented with:

- 📝 Clear explanation  
- 💻 Simple code examples  
- 💡 Practical usage

## 📁 Completed Data Structures

### 1. Singly Linked List
Basic node-based linear structure where each node points to the next.

➡️ [Code Link](./linkedList.py)

---

### 2. Stack (LIFO)
Follows Last In First Out. Implemented using list or class.

➡️ [Code Link](./stack.py)

---

### 3. Queue (FIFO)
Follows First In First Out. Implemented using list or class.

➡️ [Code Link](./queue.py)

---

### 4. Doubly Linked List
Each node links both forward and backward (next and prev).

➡️ [Code Link](./doublyLinkedList.py)

---

### 5. Circular Linked List
The last node connects back to the first, forming a loop.

➡️ [Code Link](./circularLinkedList.py)

---

### 6. Hash Table
Implements key-value storage using a simple hashing technique and collision handling via chaining.

➡️ [Code Link](./hashTable.py)

---

### 7. Binary Tree
Hierarchical structure with each node having at most 2 children.

➡️ [Code Link](./binaryTree.py)

---

### 8. Binary Search Tree (BST)
Binary tree with left < root < right. Allows fast search, insert, delete.

➡️ [Code Link](./binarySearchTree.py)

---

### 9. Heap (Min-Heap)
Binary tree where parent nodes are smaller than their children. Efficient for priority queues.

➡️ [Code Link](./heap(Min-Heap.py))

---

### 10. Trie
A tree-like structure for storing strings. Efficient for prefix-based search.

➡️ [Code Link](./Trie.py)

---

### 11. AVL Tree
A self-balancing Binary Search Tree that maintains O(log n) operations by rotating nodes when necessary.

➡️ [Code Link](./AVLTree.py)

---

### 12. HashMap vs HashSet
Comparison between Python’s `dict` (HashMap) and `set` (HashSet) with examples.

➡️ [Code Link](./HashMap_HashSet.py)

---

### 13. Graph (BFS & DFS)
Represents relationships using vertices and edges. Includes traversal techniques like BFS and DFS.

➡️ [Code Link](./graph_BFS_DFS.py)

---

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
python <filename>.py
```

Example:

```bash
python binarySearchTree.py
```

---

## 📌 Upcoming

- Segment Tree
- Topological Sort
- Dijkstra’s Algorithm
- Union-Find (Disjoint Set)
