# Data Structures with Python

This repository contains beginner-friendly implementations of fundamental data structures using Python.
Each data structure includes simple code and real-life examples to help understand the core concepts.

## ✅ Implemented Data Structures

| Data Structure | Description | File |
|----------------|-------------|------|
| Stack          | LIFO structure (like undo in an editor) | `stack.py` |
| Queue          | FIFO structure (like people in a line)  | `queue.py` |
| Linked List    | Chain of nodes with dynamic memory       | `linked_list.py` |

---

## 🧪 How to Run

```bash
python stack.py
python queue.py
python linked_list.py
```

Make sure you have Python 3 installed.

## 📚 Examples

### Stack
```python
stack = ['apple', 'banana']
stack.pop() ➜ 'banana'
```

### Queue
```python
queue = ['apple', 'banana']
queue.pop(0) ➜ 'apple'
```

### Linked List
```
apple -> banana -> cherry -> None
```
