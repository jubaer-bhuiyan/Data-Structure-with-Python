# 🧠 Data Structures with Python

This repository contains simple and beginner-friendly implementations of essential data structures using Python. Each data structure is implemented with:
- Clear explanation 📝
- Simple code examples 💻
- Practical usage 💡

---

## 📁 Completed Data Structures

### 1. Singly Linked List
Basic node-based linear structure where each node points to the next.

➡️ [Code Link](./linkedList.py)

---

### 2. Stack (LIFO)
Follows Last In First Out. Implemented using list or class.

➡️ [Code Link](./stack.py)

---

### 3. Queue (FIFO)
Follows First In First Out. Implemented using list or class.

➡️ [Code Link](./queue.py)

---

### 4. Doubly Linked List
Each node links both forward and backward (next and prev).

➡️ [Code Link](./doublyLinkedList.py)

---

### 5. Circular Linked List
The last node connects back to the first, forming a loop.

➡️ [Code Link](./circularLinkedList.py)

---

### 6. Hash Table
Implements key-value storage using a simple hashing technique and collision handling via chaining.

➡️ [Code Link](./hashTable.py)

---

### 7. Binary Tree
Hierarchical structure with each node having at most 2 children.

➡️ [Code Link](./binaryTree.py)

---

### 8. Binary Search Tree (BST)
Binary tree with left < root < right. Allows fast search, insert, delete.

➡️ [Code Link](./binarySearchTree.py)

---

### 9. Heap (Min-Heap)
Binary tree where parent nodes are smaller than their children. Efficient for priority queues.

➡️ [Code Link](./heap(Min-Heap.py))

---

## 🚀 How to Run

```bash
python <filename>.py
```

Example:

```bash
python BinarySearchTree.py
```

---

## 📌 Upcoming:
- Graph (BFS/DFS)
- Trie
- AVL Tree
- HashMap vs HashSet
- Deque
